# Linear Regression Practicals using R 📊


Welcome to the "Linear Regression Practicals using R" repository! This repository contains a collection of practical examples and resources related to linear regression analysis using the R programming language. 🚀

## About Linear Regression 📈

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It's widely used in various fields, including economics, science, and machine learning. 📚

## Repository Contents 📂

This repository includes the following:

- **Code Examples**: Practical R scripts demonstrating various aspects of linear regression, such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. 📝

- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the code examples. These datasets are used to illustrate how linear regression can be applied to real-world data. 📊

- **Images**: Visualizations and plots generated by the R scripts. 📷

## Getting Started 🛠️
